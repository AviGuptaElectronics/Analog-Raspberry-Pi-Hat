# Analog-Raspberry-Pi-Hat
Are you looking for a super easy way to measure analog Voltages using Raspberry Pi❓
Presenting 16 Channel Analog Input Hat -12Bit/10Bit as the best overall solution. 👏 theoretically there is no upper limit on analog voltage for measurement in this board. Easy to use 1206 resistors in the voltage divider on each channel lets you measure up to 100V DC on each channel in a precise manner.
⭐Unused Analog Inputs causes noise issues and hence could be Pull Up/down⭐ using easy to solder 1206 resistors
⭐Each Channel is protected💪 with overvoltage at Raspberry Pi side for safe and Reliable Operation
⭐8 Digital Inputs/Outputs are also given access of Raspberry Pi
⭐I2C Interface is provided for connecting other I2C based sensors
⭐UART Interface is also provided access of the Raspberry pi for Intercommunication between different Boards
 
Benefits:
✅16 Channel Analog Inputs ✅
✅10 Bit and 12 Bit Resolution Variants Available ✅
✅Reliable Measurement from 3.3VDC to 100 VDC on each channel ✅
✅ Overvoltage Protection💪 on each Channel ✅
✅Easy to solder Voltage- Divider 1206 Resistors ✅
